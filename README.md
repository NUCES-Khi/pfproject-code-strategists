#Project Progress Report

##Project Overview
###The project aims to develop a simple system for managing train information and passenger details. The current implementation includes structures for train schedule, train status, train information, and passenger information. It also provides functions to check train status, check booking type, and initialize a train with random status.

##Achievements
o	Structures Implemented: Successfully implemented structures for train schedule, train status, train information, and passenger information.

o	Functionality: Implemented functions to check train status, check booking type, and initialize a train with random status, but facing logical error issues which will be corrected later.

o	Randomization: Utilized the rand() function to generate random train status, adding variability to the system.

##Challenges Faced
o	Limited Scope: The current implementation is a simplified version. Expanding the system to handle more complex scenarios, multiple trains, and user interactions would be the next challenge.

o	User Interface: The system lacks a user interface, making it difficult to interact with the program in a user-friendly way.

##Future Plans
o	Expansion: Extend the system to handle multiple trains, allowing for a more comprehensive train management system.

o	User Interaction: Implement a user interface for better interaction, enabling users to input data and receive information in a more user-friendly manner.

o	Error Handling: Introduce error handling mechanisms to enhance the robustness of the system.

##Conclusion
The current implementation lays the foundation for a train management system. While it accomplishes the basic objectives, there is room for expansion and improvement. The next phase will focus on extending the functionality and enhancing the user experience.
